🌿 Roots Reconnect — Bridging Generations Through Culture

“Preserving heritage through technology.”
Roots Reconnect is a full-stack web platform that helps younger generations rediscover traditional art, folklore, and cultural values — inspired by Google Arts & Culture.

Our goal is to use digital storytelling, interactive experiences, and gamified learning to reignite interest in heritage and cultural wisdom.
